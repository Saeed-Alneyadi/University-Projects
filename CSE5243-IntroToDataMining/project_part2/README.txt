    • Student Name: Saeed Alneyadi. 11
    • Instructor Name: Dr. Huan Sun
    • Course: CSE 5243 - Intro to Data Mining
    • Section: Wed/Fri 9:35-10:55AM (7323)

Files in directory:
    • "hw3.py": Python file, it contains the code that do the asked task.
    • "dataset.txt": Dataset used by the Python file to do the asked task.
    • "README.txt": This file.
    • "hw#3-updated.pdf": pdf file to describes what is asked to be done
    • "report1.pdf": Report for the homework

How to run the file:
    • Open the terminal or powershell
    • Change the directory to the directory of the python file with its dataset using the "cd" termianl command
    • Type in the prompt "python3 hw3.py" to run the program

How to interpret the output of my code:
    • it outputs:
        • KNN Classifier Reported Values:
            • Original Dataset
                - Total Building Time (Offline Efficiency Cost)
                - Classifier Time (Online Efficiency Cost)
                - The Accuracy of the classifier respectively on training, validation and testing sets
            • Purned Dataset
                - Total Building Time (Offline Efficiency Cost)
                - Classifier Time (Online Efficiency Cost)
                - The Accuracy of the classifier respectively on training, validation and testing sets
        • Naive Bayes Classifier Reported Values:
            • Original Dataset
                - Total Building Time (Offline Efficiency Cost)
                - Classifier Time (Online Efficiency Cost)
                - The Accuracy of the classifier respectively on training, validation and testing sets
            • Purned Dataset
                - Total Building Time (Offline Efficiency Cost)
                - Classifier Time (Online Efficiency Cost)
                - The Accuracy of the classifier respectively on training, validation and testing sets
    • Each output is labeled with strings to show you what is it.
