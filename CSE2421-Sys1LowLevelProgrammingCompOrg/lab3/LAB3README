ANSWER: 26 hours

2. Short description of any concerns, interesting problems or discoveries encountered, or 
comments in general about the contents of the lab: 
ANSWER: I faced problems while using scanf() to read line after line. It result with segmentation fault.

3. Describe, with 4-5 sentences, how you used gdb to find a bug in your program while 
debugging it. Or, if you had no bugs in your program, how you used gdb to verify that 
your program was working correctly. Include how you set breakpoints, variables 
you printed out, what values they had, what you found that enabled you to fix the 
bug.
ANSWER: I used gdb to print values of variables during the program by using print and disp commands.
It was very useful tool that helps me to find bugs in my program. In addition to that, I used it to print 
the values before and after scanf() function. Not only these commands that I used, I used the next and step 
commands to move from command to command and to enter functions, respectively.
