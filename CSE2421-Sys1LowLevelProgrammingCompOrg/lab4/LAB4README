BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I STRICTLY ADHERED TO THE 
TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY’S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY. 
THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 4.

1. Student Name: Saeed Alneyadi.11

2. Total amount of time (effort) it took for you to complete the lab: 
ANSWER: 40 Hours

3. Short description of any concerns, interesting problems or discoveries encountered, or 
comments in general about the contents of the lab: 
ANSWER: I faced so many seg fault errors.

4. Describe, with 4-5 sentences, how you used gdb to find a bug in your program while 
debugging it. Or, if you had no bugs in your program, how you used gdb to verify that 
your program was working correctly. Include how you set breakpoints, variables you 
printed out, what values they had, what you found that enabled you to fix the bug. . If 
you didn’t have to use gdb to find any bugs, then use gdb to print out the value of each 
address you received from a malloc()/calloc() call, then use a breakpoint for the free() 
system call to verify that each addressed is passed to free at the end of the program. 
You may use ddd instead of gdb, if you wish.
ANSWER: The gdb was veryy helpful to me. I used to write the command make -r in the gdb intead of quiting and type it again.
I was able to still use the gdb while it running which is very cool feature. It helped me finding so many bugs inclduing seg faults.
