BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE STRICTLY ADHERED 
TO THE TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITYâ€™S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY 
WITH RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.

THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 2.

Student name: Saeed Alneyadi.11

1. Total amount of time in hours (approximate) to complete the entire lab;
24 hours

2. Short description of any concerns, interesting problems or discoveries 
encountered, or comments in general about the contents of the lab;
I faced issues with scanf() inside a loop.

3. Run gdb on your bit_decode1 executable. Enter data here that describes 
the interim values you calculated as you created your 8-bit key as you 
read in each separate digit of the 4-digit key. Specify the gdb command 
you used to print the interim values and how the values were displayed 
in gdb. For example, what is the value of key after you have read and 
processed the first digit of the key, then after you have processed the 
second digit of the key, etc. Printing the key in hexadecimal format might 
help you determine if the value you are creating is correct.

4. If you run gdb for any reason on bit_decode2, then describe why you chose 
to do so, what you did, what you saw.
I used the same input as the lab document.
